## TODO
- When grouped with ATNA expectation that the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager checks that the Patient Idendity Source is using the right identifier domain
- 2:3.104.4 Messages needs a high level explanation (see example in SVC) explaining the diagram with jumps to the different sections
- ITI-104: If the Patient Identifier Cross-reference Manager creates a "shadow copy" should the paitent id be returned in grouping with PDQm?
